# Playing Atari Game Using SB3

After we implemented the main RL algorithms in jupyter notebooks, I decide to do something advanced -- using SB3 to play atari games

In the repo, I aim to test different functions in SB3 such as wrappers and vector env. And I will implement the processing method of atari games in the first `py` file. Then I will post my result in the file later.

let's do it!
