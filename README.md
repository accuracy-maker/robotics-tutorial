# robotics-tutorial
This repo have the most detailed codes and comments of how to code RL algorithms. And it provide codes to train the robotic arms in gymnasuim-robotics which can't be found in any tutorial on the Internet
Key features:
- the clear code style
- detailed comments
- easy to run and no mistakes
