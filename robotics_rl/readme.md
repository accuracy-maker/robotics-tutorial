# Robotics Learning - RL

Now, we come to the final part of this project -- robotics learning.

I'll provide a framework to train the robotic arm in gymnasium environment using RL algorithms.

## My Contribution

- implement algorithm from scratch
- data preprocessing to make it work in gym (There isn't any tutorial on the internet)
- the framework can work in many robotic tasks
